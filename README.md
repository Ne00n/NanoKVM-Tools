# NanoKVM-Tools for Proxmox 4/5/6

DHCPv4: dhcpGen.php & iscGen.php<br>
Networkv4: subnetGen.php<br>
Networkv6: subnetGenv6.php<br>
IPv6 via radvd: radvdGen.php<br>

## Usage
If you got a /56 or larger you should assign a /64 per VM so go with radvdGen.php<br>
If you got a /64 or less, you need to configure it static, skip radvdGen.php and just use subnetGenv6.php<br>
**ndppd is needed if any IPv6 is in use.**

You likely will also need to add this to your /etc/sysctl.conf<br>
net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1<br>
net.ipv6.conf.default.forwarding=1<br>
net.ipv6.conf.all.proxy_ndp=1<br>
net.ipv6.conf.default.proxy_ndp=1<br>

All you need to do is afterwards, assign the correct MAC to a network adpater in Proxmox + correct Bridge.<br>
Depending on your setup, IPv4 and IPv6 will be assigned automatically to each VM.
